             is best known for their popular trials bikes. In 2005, they launched a range of enduro

               made in-house. Beta motorcycles have been used by world trials champions such as Jordi Tarrés,
                Dougie Lampkin, Albert Cabestany and Enduro riders Steve Holcombe
             and Brad Freeman. Production in 2018 was expected   
            to be in excess of 20,000 motorcycles, ranging in size from 50 cc to 480 cc.[1]</p>
